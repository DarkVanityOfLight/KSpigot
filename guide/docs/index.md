# KSpigot

KSpigot extends Paper (and all of its forks) with additional functionality. This reaches from small extension functions,
to features making use of Kotlin's language features and finally to bigger APIs (e.g. the GUI API).

KSpigot is [at home on GitHub](https://github.com/bluefireoly/KSpigot). Feel free to contribute to the project.

In order to get started, follow the [setup guide](setup/gradle.md).

## Contribute to this documentation

Contributions to the documentation are welcome, as it is written by the community itself.

request to the main project.
