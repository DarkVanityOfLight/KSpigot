# Upgrading to KSpigot for 1.18 (from 1.17)

## Use it with paperweight (really (like really))

Please use this library together with the paperweight Gradle plugin, as it remaps the obfuscated parts of the KSpigot
jar to mojmap, and adds all necessary dependencies with one bundle!

`settings.gradle.kts`
```kt
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        maven("https://papermc.io/repo/repository/maven-public/")
    }
}
```

`build.gradle.kts`
```kt
plugins {
    id("io.papermc.paperweight.userdev") version "VERSION"
}

dependencies {
    paperDevBundle("1.18.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
    implementation("net.axay:kspigot:1.18.0")
}
```

## Removed features

The wrapper for nbt compounds has been removed, use `CompoundTag` of net.minecraft instead!

## Upcoming features

Due to paper now being binary compatible with all other Minecraft modding toolchains, expect to see features
from [FabrikMC](https://jakobkmar.github.io/fabrikmc/) on the paper side!

## Paper first policy

From now on, KSpigot **only supports Paper**. Use it with "vanilla" Spigot at your own risk. It is highly suggested that you
use Paper together with this library.
